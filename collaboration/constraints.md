# Constraints

To ensure smooth collaboration and realistic planning, we have identified both external and internal constraints that may impact the progress of our project.

---

## External Constraints
These are factors beyond our direct control:

- **Technology Limitations** – The type of technology available to us may influence implementation and outcomes.  
- **Time Zone Differences** – Team members are located in different time zones, which can affect meeting coordination and response times.  
- **Availability** – Variability in team members’ schedules may limit synchronous collaboration.  
- **Project Deadline** – A fixed deadline requires efficient time management and prioritization.  
- **Electricity and Internet Connectivity** – Inconsistent access to power and reliable internet may hinder communication and workflow.  
- **Conflict-Related Challenges** – Ongoing war-related circumstances in certain regions may disrupt regular participation

## Internal Constraints

### Involuntary Constraints
These are limitations stemming from personal or professional responsibilities:

- **Solara** – Balancing two part-time jobs, which significantly reduce her available working hours.  
- **Aseel** – Limited background in the health field, which may affect understanding and contribution to health-related content.  
- **Ana** – Currently developing experience and may need support in technical areas.  
- **Safaa** – Managing both professional responsibilities and family commitments.

### Voluntary Constraints
These are additional activities or responsibilities the team members have chosen to undertake:

- **Solara** – Preparing for an upcoming exam, which limits her capacity during study periods.  
- **Aseel** – Participating in an Android app development program, which requires a portion of her time and focus.
