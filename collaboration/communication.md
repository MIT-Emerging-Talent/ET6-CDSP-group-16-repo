## Guidelines for Asking for Help

To maintain momentum while promoting independent problem-solving, here is a recommended approach for requesting assistance:

- **0–30 minutes**: Attempt to solve the problem independently.
- **30–60 minutes**: Consult with team members for support.
- **60+ minutes**: Reach out to mentors or coaches via Slack or GitHub for guidance.

#### Discussion Summary

 1. Suggested Topics & Purpose
• The meeting began with an a broad discussion around suggested research topics, focusing on the purpose behind each idea and why it was proposed.

 2. Solara’s Contribution
• Solara shared insights based on her realizations after Sudan’s conflict.  
• She proposed exploring the relationship between menstrual product use and infection-risk diseases among women in conflict-affected areas, emphasizing the need to highlight overlooked issues in women’s health during crises.

 3. Ana’s Contribution  
• Anna shared her interest in digital mental health and how she wants to conduct a more in depth research about it.  
• Her proposed idea centered on the correlation between screen time and mood, exploring how screen time data could potentially be used to predict daily mood levels using machine learning techniques.
 4. Reem’s Suggestion

 6. Methodology Reflection  
• The team reviewed last year’s projects to understand how data science research is conducted.  
• However, there was a mutual agreement to avoid over-focusing on data collection at this stage to keep the ideation process broad and exploratory.

#### Action Items

   the document of topics.
- Begin compiling a literature review to
   support and validate the ideas.

#### Next Steps

- **Next Meeting:** Tuesday, June 10

- **Reem:** A thorough background review of your research domain in the  
  `0_domain_research` folder of your repository.

- **Safaa:** A problem-statement based on your personal experiences.

### Additional Notes

We also addressed the questions required to complete the retrospective  
for this milestone.

### Next Steps
