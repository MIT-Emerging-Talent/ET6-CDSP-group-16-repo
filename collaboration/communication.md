To maintain momentum while promoting independent problem-solving, here is a recommended approach for requesting assistance:

- **0–30 minutes**: Attempt to solve the problem independently.
- **30–60 minutes**: Consult with team members for support.
- **60+ minutes**: Reach out to mentors or coaches via Slack or GitHub for guidance.
