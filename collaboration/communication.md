## Guidelines for Asking for Help

To maintain momentum while promoting independent problem-solving, here is a recommended approach for requesting assistance:

- **0–30 minutes**: Attempt to solve the problem independently.
- **30–60 minutes**: Consult with team members for support.
- **60+ minutes**: Reach out to mentors or coaches via Slack or GitHub for guidance.

### Meeting 01

**Date:**   Sunday, June 8
**Attendees:**   Reem, Ana, Solara, Safaa
**Next Meeting:** Tuesday, June 10

#### Discussion Summary

 1. Suggested Topics & Purpose
• The meeting began with an a broad discussion around suggested research topics, focusing on the purpose behind each idea and why it was proposed.

 2. Solara’s Contribution
• Solara shared insights based on her realizations after Sudan’s conflict.  
• She proposed exploring the relationship between menstrual product use and infection-risk diseases among women in conflict-affected areas, emphasizing the need to highlight overlooked issues in women’s health during crises.

 3. Ana’s Contribution  
• Anna shared her interest in digital mental health and how she wants to conduct a more in depth research about it.  
• Her proposed idea centered on the correlation between screen time and mood, exploring how screen time data could potentially be used to predict daily mood levels using machine learning techniques.
 4. Reem’s Suggestion  
• Reem proposed an integrated research topic combining women’s and mental health:  
• Postpartum depression detection and tracking using social media activity and wearable device data to monitor mood swings.
 5. Broader Issues Discussed  
• The group discussed the systemic neglect of women’s health, especially in institutions.  
• Highlighted how racial bias—particularly against women of color—can negatively impact treatment outcomes and access to appropriate care.
 6. Methodology Reflection  
• The team reviewed last year’s projects to understand how data science research is conducted.  
• However, there was a mutual agreement to avoid over-focusing on data collection at this stage to keep the ideation process broad and exploratory.

#### Action Items

- Each member will research further into the highlighted topics of
   the document of topics.
- Begin compiling a literature review to
   support and validate the ideas.

#### Next Steps

- **Next Meeting:** Tuesday, June 10
- **Objective:** To share findings, discuss insights, and collaboratively select one research topic for deeper exploration.

### Meeting 02

**Date:** 10th of June
**Attendees:** Solara, Ana, Safaa, Reem

---

#### Agenda  

Discussion of three shortlisted research ideas and development of potential  
research questions.

---

#### 1. Overview of Progress  

We have refined our research focus into three main ideas:

- **Digital Biomarkers and Postpartum Depression:** Investigating how digital  
  biomarkers (from wearables and social media data) can help identify early  
  symptoms and key risk factors for postpartum depression, focusing on mood  
  instability.

- **Bias Against Black Pregnant Women in Healthcare:** Examining how gender and  
  ethnicity bias impacts Black pregnant women, especially related to maternal  
  morbidity and mortality.

- **Menstrual Hygiene in Humanitarian Settings:** Exploring menstrual hygiene  
  practices, product types used, and links to UTIs and skin diseases in conflict  
  and disaster-affected settings.

---

#### 2. Discussion Highlights  

##### A. Digital Biomarkers and Postpartum Depression  

Built on previous discussion by exploring concrete research directions.

**Potential research questions proposed:**  

- Can digital data biomarkers be used to identify early signs of postpartum  
  depression?  
- Can digital biomarkers detect early risk factors of postpartum depression?  
- What digital biomarkers are most effective in identifying mood instability  
  and potential postpartum depression during the first year after childbirth?

We emphasized investigating which digital indicators are most relevant, and  
how early detection via wearables or social media can be achieved.

##### B. Bias Against Black Pregnant Women  

Focus on gender and ethnicity bias against Black pregnant women continued.

Discussion led to a more specific direction: examining the relationship between  
maternal health outcomes (morbidity/mortality) and bias in clinical settings.

Research question is still in development but more clearly defined.

##### C. Menstrual Hygiene in Humanitarian Settings  

Agreed to broaden scope from only conflict zones to include disaster settings  
for greater inclusivity and flexibility.

Research will focus on:  

- Types and prevalence of menstrual products used and challenges of access.  
- The relationship between menstrual hygiene and UTIs and skin diseases.

Continued work is needed to finalize the research question.

---

#### 3. Next Steps  

- Each member will conduct a final round of research and begin drafting specific  
  research questions for the three topics.  
- Next meeting scheduled for Friday to:  
  - Present refined research questions.  
  - Debate each idea’s strengths and feasibility.  
  - Agree on a final research topic to pursue.
