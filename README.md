## 💡 About This Project

> *Note: This section will be completed as we define the problem, conduct research, and move forward with planning.*

### 📌 Problem Statement

### 📚 Domain Research

Find our literature review and research documents in the `0_domain_research` folder.

### 🧠 Understanding of the Problem Domain

We applied **systems thinking** using the **Iceberg Model** to understand the  systemic nature of bias against Black pregnant women in healthcare.  
This model helps us go beyond visible events and explore deeper patterns, structures, and mental models.

### Event (What we see)

Black pregnant women experience  
**significantly higher maternal morbidity and mortality rates**  
compared to white women. These outcomes are frequently reported in the media, scientific literature,  
and government health statistics.

**Examples:**

- Delayed responses to severe pregnancy symptoms.  
- Reports of preventable deaths due to misdiagnosis or inaction.  
- Underreporting or dismissal of pain or complications during  
  prenatal/postnatal care.

### Pattern / Trend

- The maternal mortality rate for Black women in the U.S. is **3–4 times higher** than that of white women.  
- Black women face higher risk of complications such as preeclampsia, cardiomyopathy, and hemorrhage.  
- Structural stressors, described by the **weathering hypothesis**, accelerate health deterioration due to chronic exposure to racism and discrimination.

### Structure

- **Lack of culturally competent care** and poor inclusion of equity in medical protocols.  
- **Inequitable access to care**, with Black women often having less access to postpartum services or insurance coverage.  
- **Underrepresentation of Black healthcare professionals**.  
- **Limited bias training** in medical education and institutional denial of systemic racism in care practices.

### Mental Model

- The false assumption that Black women are more biologically resistant to pain.
- A tendency to blame poor maternal outcomes on individual behavior instead of systemic failure.
- Lack of awareness about racism’s role in clinical decision-making.  
- Historic and persistent medical mistrust from Black communities based on centuries of abuse.
