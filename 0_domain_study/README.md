## ⚠️ Problem Statement

After watching a video where a Black woman shared her traumatic experience
during and after childbirth, our group was struck by the repeated of
neglect, miscommunication, and bias in her care.

She described:

- Being ignored when expressing concerns  
- Clinicians assuming she had undergone FGM without asking  
- Her pain being downplayed — even when it turned out to be serious

Hearing her story left us deeply uncomfortable and full of questions:

> Why wasn’t she listened to?  
> Why were assumptions made without proper communication?  
> Would her experience have been different if she were of another race?

These reflections pushed us to examine how institutional practices may
fail to serve all patients equally — especially Black women.

This is not an isolated case, but a reflection of a deeper, systemic issue:  
**institutional racism in maternal healthcare.**

It led us to explore how clinical documentation and healthcare decisions
may be shaped by unconscious bias — and how this contributes to racial
disparities in maternal mortality.

## 🧠 Understanding of the Problem Domain

We applied **systems thinking** using the **Iceberg Model** to understand the  
systemic nature of bias against Black pregnant women in healthcare.  
This model helps us go beyond visible events and explore deeper patterns,  
structures, and mental models.

### Event (What we see)

Black pregnant women experience  
**significantly higher maternal morbidity and mortality rates**  
compared to white women.  
These outcomes are frequently reported in the media, scientific literature,  
and government health statistics.

**Examples:**

- Delayed responses to severe pregnancy symptoms.
- Reports of preventable deaths due to misdiagnosis or inaction.  
- Underreporting or dismissal of pain or complications during  
  prenatal/postnatal care.

### Pattern / Trend

- The maternal mortality rate for Black women in the U.S. is  
  **3–4 times higher** than that of white women.  
- Black women face higher risk of complications such as  
  preeclampsia, cardiomyopathy, and hemorrhage.  
- Structural stressors, described by the **weathering hypothesis**,  
  accelerate health deterioration due to chronic exposure to racism  
  and discrimination.

### Structure

- **Lack of culturally competent care** and poor inclusion of equity  
  in medical protocols.  
- **Inequitable access to care**, with Black women often having  
  less access to postpartum services or insurance coverage.  
- **Underrepresentation of Black healthcare professionals**.  
- **Limited bias training** in medical education and institutional denial  
  of systemic racism in care practices.

### Mental Model

- The false assumption that Black women are more biologically  
  resistant to pain.  
- A tendency to blame poor maternal outcomes on individual behavior  
  instead of systemic failure.  
- Lack of awareness about racism’s role in clinical decision-making.  
- Historic and persistent medical mistrust from Black communities  
  based on centuries of abuse.
