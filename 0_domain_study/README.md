## ⚠️ Problem Statement

After watching a video where a Black woman shared her traumatic experience
during and after childbirth, our group was struck by the repeated of
neglect, miscommunication, and bias in her care.

She described:

- Being ignored when expressing concerns  
- Clinicians assuming she had undergone FGM without asking  
- Her pain being downplayed — even when it turned out to be serious

Hearing her story left us deeply uncomfortable and full of questions:

> Why wasn’t she listened to?  
> Why were assumptions made without proper communication?  
> Would her experience have been different if she were of another race?

These reflections pushed us to examine how institutional practices may
fail to serve all patients equally — especially Black women.

This is not an isolated case, but a reflection of a deeper, systemic issue:  
**institutional racism in maternal healthcare.**

It led us to explore how clinical documentation and healthcare decisions
may be shaped by unconscious bias — and how this contributes to racial
disparities in maternal mortality.

## 🧠 Understanding of the Problem Domain

We applied **systems thinking** using the **Iceberg Model** to understand the  
systemic nature of bias against Black pregnant women in healthcare.  
This model helps us go beyond visible events and explore deeper patterns,  
structures, and mental models.

### Event (What we see)

Black pregnant women experience  
**significantly higher maternal morbidity and mortality rates**  
compared to white women.  
These outcomes are frequently reported in the media, scientific literature,  
and government health statistics.

**Examples:**

- Delayed responses to severe pregnancy symptoms.
- Reports of preventable deaths due to misdiagnosis or inaction.  
- Underreporting or dismissal of pain or complications during  
  prenatal/postnatal care.

### Pattern / Trend

- The maternal mortality rate for Black women in the U.S. is  
  **3–4 times higher** than that of white women.  
- Black women face higher risk of complications such as  
  preeclampsia, cardiomyopathy, and hemorrhage.  
- Structural stressors, described by the **weathering hypothesis**,  
  accelerate health deterioration due to chronic exposure to racism  
  and discrimination.

### Structure

- **Lack of culturally competent care** and poor inclusion of equity  
  in medical protocols.  
- **Inequitable access to care**, with Black women often having  
  less access to postpartum services or insurance coverage.  
- **Underrepresentation of Black healthcare professionals**.  
- **Limited bias training** in medical education and institutional denial  
  of systemic racism in care practices.

### Mental Model

- The false assumption that Black women are more biologically  
  resistant to pain.  
- A tendency to blame poor maternal outcomes on individual behavior  
  instead of systemic failure.  
- Lack of awareness about racism’s role in clinical decision-making.  
- Historic and persistent medical mistrust from Black communities  
  based on centuries of abuse.

## ❓ Research Question

1. **Is there a statistically significant association between higher rates of  
   maternal morbidity and mortality and being a Black woman?**

2. **To what extent do maternal morbidity and mortality rates differ between  
   Black women and women of other races?**

3. **How does the language used in clinical notes for Black pregnant women  
   differ from that used for women of other races, and how are these  
   linguistic patterns associated with maternal morbidity and mortality  
   outcomes?**
